# scala-meteor-chat

This project is an attempt to get [Atmosphere](http://atmosphere.java.net/) working with Scala and Jetty.  I attempted to get it running in place of socket-io in a substantial project but I was getting nowhere fast, so I decided to boil things down into something repeatable and shareable.

This project is based on the [meteor-chat example](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/tree/master/samples/meteor-chat) provided with Atmosphere.

##Â Changes to date

So far this example is still completely in Java.  The only changes to date are the creation of an [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki) build file `build.sbt` which uses the [xsbt-web-plugin](https://github.com/siasia/xsbt-web-plugin) with it's configuration in the `project/plugins/build.sbt` file.

This allows the project to be built and run with the commands:

    sbt
    > jetty-run

On top of that I have carried out some changes described below as fixes to problems I encountered.

Now I have still have a problem as there is an error message being generated although in other respects the system now appears to be working.  Here is the log message:

Note, in particular the `has suspended a connection from 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%0` error message.

## Problems along the way

Here are some problems I ran across and found fixes to.

### 404 error in the browser trying to access /atmosphere-meteor-chat/Meteor?0

I was getting browser errors trying to access `/atmosphere-meteor-chat/Meteor?0` and realised that the path in the `web.xml` file did not match the path in the `application.js` file.  So I changed line 3 of `application.js` from:

    url: '/atmosphere-meteor-chat/Meteor',

to

    url: '/Meteor',

### NoSuchMethodError for HttpServletRequest.isAsyncStarted using Jetty 7.3.1.v20110307

To start off using Jetty `7.3.1.v20110307` I was getting a no such method error for `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.isAsyncStarted`.  This error went away when I upgraded to Jetty `8.0.0.M3`.

Here was the error stacktrace:

    [warn] Error for /Meteor
