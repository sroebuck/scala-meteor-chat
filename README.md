# scala-meteor-chat

This project is an attempt to get [Atmosphere](http://atmosphere.java.net/) working with Scala and Jetty with as simple an example as possible.  I attempted to get it running in place of socket-io in a substantial project but I was getting nowhere fast, so I decided to boil things down into something repeatable and shareable.

This project is based on the [meteor-chat example](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/tree/master/samples/meteor-chat) provided with Atmosphere.

##Â Changes to date

This example now appears to work and uses Scala.

An [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki) build file `build.sbt` has been created which uses the [xsbt-web-plugin](https://github.com/siasia/xsbt-web-plugin) with it's configuration in the `project/plugins/build.sbt` file.

This allows the project to be built and run with the commands:

    sbt
    > jetty-run

The Java class "MeteorChat" has been converted to "Scala" with relatively little change in code style.

On top of that I have carried out some changes described below as fixes to problems I encountered.

Now I have still have a problem as there is an error message being generated although in other respects the system now appears to be working.  Here is the log message:

    21:59:12.916 [Atmosphere-AsyncWrite-0] INFO  o.a.commons.util.EventsLogger - onBroadcast(): AtmosphereResourceEventImpl{isCancelled=false, isResumedOnTimeout=false, message=<script type='text/javascript'>

    </script>

     HttpServletResponse: HTTP/1.1 200 

Note, in particular the `has suspended a connection from 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%0` error message.

However, I'm not sure this is actually an error, it may just be information output related to the using Comet.  So my
next issue is to get it to use websockets.

## Problems along the way

Here are some problems I ran across and found fixes to.

### 404 error in the browser trying to access /atmosphere-meteor-chat/Meteor?0

I was getting browser errors trying to access `/atmosphere-meteor-chat/Meteor?0` and realised that the path in the `web.xml` file did not match the path in the `application.js` file.  So I changed line 3 of `application.js` from:

    url: '/atmosphere-meteor-chat/Meteor',

to

    url: '/Meteor',

### NoSuchMethodError for HttpServletRequest.isAsyncStarted using Jetty 7.3.1.v20110307

To start off using Jetty `7.3.1.v20110307` I was getting a no such method error for `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.isAsyncStarted`.  This error went away when I upgraded to Jetty `8.0.0.M3`.

Here was the error stacktrace:

    [warn] Error for /Meteor
    java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.isAsyncStarted()Z
    	at org.atmosphere.container.Servlet30Support.suspend(Servlet30Support.java:136)

    	at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:820)
    	at org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHolder.handle(ServletHolder.java:534)

However, having read more about the version of Jetty here: <http://java.dzone.com/articles/roadmap-jetty-6-jetty-7-and>
I would prefer to run under Jetty 7 which seems more aligned to likely deployment at the present time.

I tried what appeared to be the latest official release: `7.5.0.v20110901` but this failed with a different error.

I tried the latest official release from one of the maven indexes: `7.4.5.v20110725` but this failed with the same `isAsyncStarted` error which I now understand to be due to the lack of Servlet 3.0 support.  So I tried this save
version with Atmosphere `0.7.2`.  This still generated the `isAsyncStarted` error.  However, given that this was trying to use the Servlet 3.0 API I noticed that I was including:

    "org.apache.geronimo.specs" % "geronimo-servlet_3.0_spec" % "1.0",

and changed this back to:

    "org.apache.geronimo.specs" % "geronimo-servlet_2.4_spec" % "1.0",

and it worked.  Then I noticed that the `scalatra` codebase chose to include:

    "javax.servlet" % "javax.servlet-api" % "3.0.1" % "provided"

instead, so I tried that and, although it is the Servlet 3.x API it also works!

I also tried changing the version of Atmosphere back to `0.7.2` and found that this worked fine again.  So my conslusion
here is that it is much better to include: `javax.servlet-api 3.0.1` than `geronimo-servlet_3.0_spec 1.0`.    

## Help much appreciated
